Design Decisions: 

#Overview: 

I went with a clean design with little background noise and text. I wanted the eye to be drawn to the discounts and destination photos.

#Top Logo: 

I  combined and image of mountains, a city sky line and a palm tree with a faded background of photos of each 
location with a plane taking off from one corner. 

These three images represent the three most common destinations for travel and blended well to form a unique icon to 
represent a travel company. 

#Header Image

I chose to go with a stock photo of a stamped passport with a phone screen lit up next to it 
because the email is directing someone to click through the email (which statistically speaking is probably being 
viewed on a phone) or application to receive 10% off. The correlation 
between the offer on the phone screen and the stamped passport reinforces the idea to click through. 

#Body / Content

With the three sections I kept a clean design, and one that is easy to digest on both a computer and phone screen. 
Simple text with clear CTAâ€™s.
